              <p>The ex-Senior Writer at Vogue can be found deep in the closets of some of the hottest names in fashion, where she unpacks the secrets in the clothes they've never worn on her show...NEVERWORNS.
              Closet shrink Liana Satenstein tells us what to wear to get the job.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Okay, hopefully this picks up.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">So, basically, I went into the office one day and I was looking pretty horrible. I went on TikTok. I was seeing people do these things, and I did it kind of sarcastically. People couldn't tell if it was satire or real.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I remember the comments were a little confused.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">It was just funny because I did that and I started doing a few more, but then it felt kind of vacuous. We're in the most international spot in New York.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah, Union Square.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I mean Nordstrom Rack. Everyone is coming for discounts. I used to live in Queens way out next to the airport, and I would go to Rego Park Century 21. You feel like you're in Eastern Europe.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">It was my boyfriend's idea to do it at Nordstrom Rack and I totally jumped on it because it's really universal. It's not a thrift store, but you definitely have to search.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. you can find some great stuff, though. But yeah, I like this. Never pay full price. Okay, so what did I do—you're gonna have a real field day transcribing this, my friend. Okay, so I was doing TikTok, though. I'm sort of mortified that people know me through that, but I guess that's good. But it's not who I am, really. The outfit stuff gets very exhausting, because I only own so many clothes. I'm not going to go into the office every single day with a new outfit.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Well, I think that's kind of the vibe I got from you. There's a very specific TikTok energy, especially with outfit videos and I didn't get that from you and I think that's why I was intrigued. I didn't believe you when you said you worked at Vogue. I couldn't believe that someone would be that accessible or open. Does that make sense?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I get it. We watch the Devil Wears Prada. I can understand how that could be the thought process.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">But from the outside I thought you were cool and effortless. Then I was like, I like her style. I don't really follow anyone on Tik Tok. I just let the for-you page work its magic and show it to me again. If it knows me, It'll give it back.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Oh, it's like a boomerang.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah, I'm just like, "Okay, algorithm. Go ahead, do your thing." And then you popped up again, maybe like a year later.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Oh, wow. What was I doing this time?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I think you were interviewing another fashion writer.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I probably was harassing my former editor.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">And then from there I just found your Instagram. And then I read your blog, NEVERWORNS. And then I watched your interviews and I liked it. That's why I asked to interview you. The idea for the Nordstrom Rack is that I just quit my job and am looking for a new outfit for my next interview. I used to work in an art gallery.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Oh, wow. Gallery girl. What did you do there?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I was at the front desk.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">That's a killer job. Like, that makes me feel like it's the 1990s, you're in Chelsea and you're answering calls. I don't know if that's even how it is anymore. But it sounds glam.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">It was. When I first got the job, I was head over heels.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Listen for the first few months, you are like, "This is incredible. This is great." And then you're like, oh, fuck, it's like actually a job.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. I used to work across from Paint 'N Pour, which is the place where people go to paint sunsets and palm trees while they drink wine. And I was like, what if I was a paint instructor? And I was thinking today at Nordstrom Rack, we can find an interview outfit. Where do you usually start when picking out an outfit?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Pants, probably. Then you can build it up. What do you like? I like a good slack moment where you can transition it to just going out and doing nothing. You should try a low slung, pinstripe pants. Oh, wait, these aren't horrible. There's an embedded pleat.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Did you always want to be a fashion writer? Where do you go to school? How did you start?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts. Very pilgrim vibes. Nothing to do. I was always very bored, so I really wanted to get out of there. I think magazines were an incredible outlet for me at the time. I started going on the internet more and fashion was like a huge outlet for me. Just the idea of fashion and New York. I knew I always wanted to get into it somehow. I think like every girl during my era watched Devil Wears Prada and thought they could be that girl. I think hordes of women actually moved here inspired by that movie that was supposed to make you not want to work in this world. I still think it has that power, weirdly. I ended up actually leaving school my senior year and I studied in Ukraine for a year when it was Crimea. My grandmother was from Kiev back in the day and she escaped from there after some heinous shit went down. I was always interested in my roots. For background, I'm Jewish American. I was the only Jewish person in my town, so I always felt a little bit different and wanted to rediscover who I am and where I came from. Anyways, this program came to my school and they were like, "You can study anywhere in the world and we will pay for your plane ticket." I was like, I'm getting the fuck out of here. I left my high school boyfriend and I studied in Ukraine for a year. I was working in the community a lot when I came back. Then I studied in St. Petersburg for a year and then I moved to New York finally. I got an apartment with two Russian women next to the airport in Queens, so I learned basically how to speak provincial bootleg Russian. When I was here, I was trying to get a job and I couldn't get a job. I interned at Women's Wear Daily and I had interned at Marie Claire. I was not a great intern. One of them was working in the fashion closet and checking in and out samples. I was like, what the fuck am I doing? Marie Claire was fine, I just don't think I fit in very well. I felt like smelly-girl-at-the-lunch-table vibes. I was doing odd jobs in the city. I did sales for some guy in Chelsea, then I found this job off of Craigslist and got fired from that. I was a hostess actually in Tribeca at some Austrian sausage, brunch, place. I was doing all these things while I was fucking hating my life because I was sitting in this Tribeca restaurant watching these bitches come in and get their reservation. Anyways, long story short, I ended up paying my own way to go to Ukraine and photograph Fashion Week there. I told Women's Wear Daily I was going and, because I was still tight with the accessories editor there, I got like my first clip. I pitched to Fashionista at the time. I went to Crown Heights and I photographed these Orthodox Jewish women who dress really well. There's some really interesting ways of how they approach dress because, when you're Orthodox you can't show your body, so they have to figure out different ways to tweak and dress but still be chic. Then Vogue reached out one day on LinkedIn. And then I met with the then creative director and my then boss. And that was it. And I was so broke. I spent all my money on printing my resume and it was so expensive because I was doing it at Staples.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Were you doing fancy paper? Did you have a folder and everything for it?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. I think I still have a copy of this whole thing that I did because I was printing out clips and PDFs, too. I'd written for Vogue Ukraine at this point, which was cool. But, yeah, I was there for almost nine years. Until January 6: forever the day known as when I left Vogue and also the insurrection. I still write for them. And I still love my boss and I love every single person and I think that's why I was there for a long time, too.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">First of all, I can't even believe that Vogue reached out through LinkedIn.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Girl, me too. The woman at the time—she was active. I made sure to put all my clips on there and everything I was doing. I was like throwing everything out into the universe to make it happen.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. Also doing. Is that a part of manifestation?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Oh yeah, you gotta do it. You can't just wish upon a star and then get it, you know?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I don't know. Manifestation is a weird word that people use now.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah, I started to hear it more during COVID when people were desperate for hope. They couldn't control what was going on around them, so they had to manifest their way out of COVID or quarantine.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">That's a good way to put it.</div>
            </div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">So you left recently to start NEVERWORNS full time?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. I'm working on a few projects too, which are on the DL. NEVERWORNS is public, obviously. I love doing it. I love talking to people about their clothes, but not really about their clothes. For example, I don't give a shit if you're wearing COMME Des GARÇONS, blah blah blah whatever. I want to know how you got to wearing that and I think clothes are the most epic vehicle for opening someone up. Oh, it's my friend, Nima. "Nima! What's up?"</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-narrative">
              <p>While walking past the shoe aisles, Liana bumps into an old friend that knew her pre-Vogue. A stop-and-chat commences.</p>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Now you know. I also don't know what you should wear for the top portion. I kind of feel you should do sporty. Okay, where were we?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>
              <div class="interview-response">You were talking about NEVERWORNS and that clothes are good to get to know someone.</div>

            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Liana</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Right. It's a good way to get to know someone and to have them open up because everyone has clothes and they all tell some sort of story. If you sat down with me and you just started with my clothes—</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Daniela</div>

              <div class="interview-response">So my mom is an antique dealer and she finds all these things at thrift shops and stuff and she found these in a jar somewhere. She found these gold hoops and these diamonds for nothing. [Points at her top] I bought this with her. I had her come up to New York like seven years ago. We went to some thrift shop in the East Village owned by some Russian woman. I think her name is Angelica. She yells a lot. These pants which I got on The RealReal. They're old Dolce. I got them for nothing. It's a full suit, I'm just not wearing the suit jacket. I wear them because I like them low-slung. I was going through a suit phase because I was going through this y2k "I'm crazy and I'm into Blumarine" phase. I needed a tabula rasa sort of vibe. And then the shoes are actually my mom's, which I'm pretty sure she got at Filene's Basement. I don't know if you have that in Miami, but it was like Nordstrom Rack but more designer.</div>

I went to Hofstra which is in Long Island. I'd never been to Long Island. I didn't tour colleges. I just was like, Oh, they gave me money? I guess I'll go there.

Also, just being sad at Fashion Week because you see all these clothes come down the runway, you hear where they're sourcing them, and it's just like, none of this needs to be made. We would be fine if we just used deadstock and wore old clothes for the rest of our lives. It's killing us, truly. Why not just buy used? You can wear your own shit, no one else has it, and you're not buying new things. I just think people should use deadstock. Companies should use deadstock.

I'm like, "What are you interested in?" They can't tell you. They're like, "I liked the Miu Miu runway." And I'm like, "Me too, but why?" Explain to me what that gives you as a feeling.

              <div class="interview-response">When you're basically overloaded with information like that, it's easy to be swayed. For me personally, I just don't connect with Runway. I've always found it very unattainable for me specifically. My mood is more seeing a girl on the street who's dressed really well and just has something about her. That's what I want. It's not seeing something on the runway. I'm more in the vein of the everyday and taking bits and pieces from people that I like. [Gestures towards an older woman while we're waiting to cross Fifth Ave.] For example, this woman walking here. I love her linen pants and sports shoes, the little jewelry and the sporty casual bag. Am I gonna wear the whole entire thing? No, but maybe I'll take a part of that. [A man cuts through the crowd wearing a pair of neon green sunglasses above his prescription glasses] I love when men wear double glasses like that guy over there. I think it's incredible because you know that they're actually wearing it and using it. I just find some of this stuff on the runway to be cheap shots for fucking TikTok, at this point. I hate it. No one's just walking around in a miniskirt where you can see your labia hanging out. It looks horrible. What job are you going to in that? I want to see women who are working and look good moving through the world. I want to see what they're wearing and where they're going. I don't want to see some girl who's not going anywhere. But, I get it. Like, we have to do these things. But, that's being sold in stores? I just don't understand. I'm also the worst person for fashion.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">It depends. I like doing it, but is it useful for people? I don't know. Sometimes something does really well, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know if people want to read six paragraphs about a visor that I bought on Amazon, but I like doing this stuff because I think there's a lot of cool history that you can weave into it. I think people really like service-y things. Like, "Buy These Five Things".</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Who am I obsessed with? Maybe it's not specific people, but I have like 10 films that I watch on repeat constantly. I like movies about women navigating the city. It's always these movies from 1996 to 2003, give or take. A Perfect Murder with Gwyneth Paltrow. Every woman needs to watch this. She's an uptown zillionaire married to another zillionaire and the wardrobe is incredible and she's having an affair. Sliding Doors. Gwyneth Paltrow, again. This is your homework. She's in England this time. Great style moment. Unfaithful. Diane Lane. Also a woman in the city. Cheats on her husband in Connecticut with a hot French guy who was in the city. Kissing Jessica Stein. Incredible film. You should watch it for style. I think a lot of fashion changed after 9/11. This was filmed pre 9/11. Fashion is incredible. It's about this artist-girl who works at a newspaper and is dating all these loser guys. She puts an ad in a newspaper because that's how people used to meet each other. She ends up meeting this girl and they end up having a relationship, but it doesn't matter. Plot—who cares? It's more about the style and how the dichotomy between the two women and the styles that they adopt from one another. Basic Instinct with Sharon Stone. I love Sharon Stone. She's like the epitome of the confident, horrible woman that I aspire to be. Girl 6. Spike Lee. Incredible New York movie. The critics hated it. Incredible style wise and the way it was shot is really great. She plays a call girl. Naomi Campbell's in it. Nine and a Half Weeks. Ken Baysinger and Mickey Rourke. This is more 80s, but still amazing. Big shoulders. She works at an art gallery. Sweetest Thing with Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate. It's just a good girl movie. Fun 2000s one. I watch films that give me a mood. Like, I want to be that person. Like, tripping down in Tribeca into some guy's arms while I'm wearing an incredible trench coat and that square toe that we saw at Nordstrom.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">It's just people I'm genuinely interested in. The issue with media is that, of course, celebrities give you numbers. It's similar to the Miu Miu thing where people don't know why they liked the show. You should always do something because you like it, not because it's popular. You should be genuinely interested in it because then you will ask the right questions and make a compelling story. I want to know what people are doing and how they actually exist and live through the world, not just like how they live in a photo. Once numbers start dictating things for you, it's a slippery slope. You lose credibility because you're just in it yourself. Like, when I do sponsored content I have to be very careful about what I do. I work with The Real Real and that's because they let me do what I want. You have to be careful and you have to always say something with what you're putting out into the world.</div>
