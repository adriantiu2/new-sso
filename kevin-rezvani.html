              <div class="interview-response">I started a real estate company in the city about 13 years ago. That did alright. I used to have five burger shops in Jersey, but during COVID there was a dispute and I was forced out. Things kind of went downhill. I was broke. I was living on my boys couch in Queens. Then I was doing Amazon delivery about two and a half years ago. Five days in, I stopped and came back to the city, put 7th Street on my credit card, opened it and then three months later it blew up.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">We pretty much stayed pretty much the same since then. I think we went up 50 cents one day about two years ago. Nothing really too crazy. We had some complaints about being too expensive but people are gonna complain no matter what, right? You're not gonna make everybody happy.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Rutgers. I studied Middle Eastern Studies and didn't take any business classes. I went to school the first time, failed out, and then went back when I was 22. You don't need business classes to start a business. Stuff like this you just gotta do it. It's more of an experience thing.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">You don't have to be smart to make money. You just can't be scared to go for it. A lot of people I know overanalyze it all. Half the time we open a new store I forget everything we did at the last store. We just opened our eighth store two weeks ago and I don't remember the process of how I did it. We probably overlooked a million things and probably failed a lot of permits and inspections.</div>

Our first late night there were like no customers, but we stuck with it and people started coming in and now it's what it is now. I still get nervous that we won't be busy next week.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">We didn't do much marketing, but TikTok blew us up. Not even our TikTok. Just, like, food reviewers. The amount of people that used to come and be like, "We found you through TikTok"—I'm like, "Damn." TikTok puts Instagram to shame.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">For sure. Everyone's just so health concerned these days that that's what made us stand out. For a while, it was whoever had the cuter place and the nicer little neon sign. I was so against that. I don't want anything social media related here. I think it's so corny. The menu is a temporary menu I found on Amazon when I didn't know what else to do. The only thing I thought about in terms of the branding was to make it look like it's old so that when you walk in here, you think it's been here for 30 years. I was looking up names of different pizza places that have been here for 30, 40 years and it's all simple names like Joe's pizza, Prince Street Pizza, those kinds of places. So we wanted to do something that resonated with the neighborhood and the street and, at the same time, didn't stand out too much. The name is so simple, but I must've gone through a thousand names before I landed on it.</div>
