            <div class="interview-intro">
              <p>"They're either scary or silly," Kiel said when I asked him what he thought about puppets. It was a brisk morning in early March. We were walking across the Boston Common. I've known Kiel for ten years; I respect his opinions, and I found myself agreeing with his latest. Scary or silly was about right. Our destination – the Boston Puppet Collective and Library – had colored the morning's conversation. I hoped that an hour there might inject some nuance into our opinions. Besides, the collective's website showcased a vast selection of enormous wearable puppet-creatures, and I wanted to put Kiel in one. The collective occupies two basement rooms underneath the Emmanuel Episcopal Church, a stone's throw from Newbury Street's designer outlets and expensive hamburgers. We knocked on a broad door, feeling a bit like speakeasy patrons. A head popped out of the wall to our left: Sara Peattie, head of the Boston Puppet Collective, introduced herself. We shook hands and followed her into her domain. Kiel and I, heads bent under the low ceilings, slowly got our bearings. The space was stuffed with puppets and the materials used to make them: bits of construction paper, pipe cleaners, old newspapers, clay. Peattie explained that we were standing in the collective's workshop. Next door was the library. People were free to come and borrow puppets for parades, school plays or a jaunt in the park. I wondered how often they did that as I wandered around the place. To me, it seemed more museum than library: cavernous; the objects on display unified by their single medium – papier-mache. But the puppets here were not organized according to some curatorial principle; rather, they represented the personal tastes, artistic inclinations and whimsy of Boston's puppeteer community, a community that was clearly craftier and more alive than I had thought possible. Their output was prodigious. Most of the puppets were animals, as if a papier-mache menagerie had escaped from a zoo and found refuge here. Lions and tigers lay curled in corners, a row of seahorses pinned to a wall. A frog, given a slightly dour expression, had made its nest in a heap of fabric. After we finished our tour of the workshop and the library, Kiel and I sat down with Sara. Flanked by a pair of enormous roses and the head of a pterodactyl, we talked about the collective, scary puppets and life as a member of the puppeteering community – "a small town that's all over the world."</p>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Kiel</div>
              <div class="interview-response">So we wanna start off talking about the history of the collective. Do you know when it was founded?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yes! I was there. My partner and I – George Connaugh (?) – founded it in San Francisco in…I'm gonna say '76. And I've been involved with it since, you know, dropping in and out. We were in San Francisco for a year and a half and then moved back east. One thing about San Francisco is that the clouds aren't good there.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">They have fog, they don't have real clouds. It got on my nerves. And George I think wanted to get away from his mother.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Then we were working in Vermont and in New York a lot; we still have a section in New York. And George died, um, in 2001. Right before September 11. George died and the whole world went up in flames.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">I don't know; it's not a relationship they have a name for, and I worked with him very closely through a couple of wives and a bunch of girlfriends; we were also involved emotionally.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Kiel</div>
              <div class="interview-response">You two were the main founders of the collective, but what inspired you both to create all this?</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Max</div>
              <div class="interview-response">And you said you were apprenticed to a puppeteer. Does that mean your parents pushed you to be an apprentice or you chose yourself to be an apprentice?</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Kiel</div>
              <div class="interview-response">So you started the collective with two people. How has it grown or changed over time?</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">It sort of…morphed. I came here and I started working also with another group – Back Alley Puppet Theater – and the Northeast Kingdom Puppet Theater, who had taken over from Black Wheat Puppet Theater, who were here, but were not the original puppeteers who were here, and then they changed names and morphed and sort of left and Back Alley sort of…became entangled with Puppet Co-op – Back Alley doing Boston stuff and building stuff much quieter, more respectable, and Puppeteers Co-op doing workshops around the country and doing big parades. A much more loud and traveling group of people. We were working a lot with First Night, which at the time was expanding madly, and we were doing First Nights all around the country, and they all had puppets and parades.</div>
            </div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Kiel</div>
              <div class="interview-response">It sounds like there are actually quite a lot of puppet groups that maybe someone like myself might not have heard of, but that are actually expansive and everywhere.</div>

            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah, there are a lot of puppet groups everywhere…in the world!</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Not a competitor! Go talk to the Puppet Showplace, they have the Puppetry Guild, which has many member groups.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Kiel</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I feel like puppets aren't most people's hobby, so when they come together it seems like a pretty welcoming group, yeah?</div>

            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">A lot of them. Puppeteers have a funny, um, a funny civilization. It's a lot of potlucks, it's a lot of meetings; it's like a small town that's all over the world. There's an origin story about the puppeteers which is probably not true but which I really like, which is that Tony Sark, who was an early puppeteer – he invented the inflatables for Macy's Parade – went to Europe and learned the secrets of marionette shows by looking up to where the strings were so he could find out how they worked. When he came back to the United States, he got everybody together and taught them what he'd learned. Ever since then the puppeteers here have festivals and potlucks and teach each other everything they know. Which isn't true of most arts.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="interview-pair">
              <div class="interview-speaker">Max</div>
              <div class="interview-response">So you're generous with knowledge, everyone shares in it.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Wherever it comes from; that's the social life we have.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Kiel</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. I also do toy theater, which is sort of expansive in a way because you can do a little box with puppets this big in it and it's a whole world. You can have a meteor crashing into the world and everything exploding because it's so small.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Max</div>

              <div class="interview-response">I make a lot of them. People drop things off (points to a papier-mache pterodactyl) – somebody just appeared at the backdoor with it. A lot of them are similar because they're made over clay. You make a clay positive and then put papier-mache over it and pop it off.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">So the collective has a model where you guys allow anyone to come in and take any puppet for free. How did you come to the decision not to charge anyone money and just make it an open resource?</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Because…because it would be more trouble than it's worth, charging money. The church wants something socially relevant to be happening here. When people donate money to us I often give it to the church, because we couldn't afford to rent a broom closet around here. So that free model actually pays for a huge amount of space in the center of Boston. It's a pretty sweet deal when you come right down to it.</div>

They let us be here – we never had any agreement with them, we're just here. At one point we were donating ten percent of any money we made to them and the church said "Oh, you're tithing."

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah. Or the fact that they move in a certain way gives them personality. I reverse-engineered some puppets from a leaflet about Malian puppets – apparently they have a huge tradition there – but these puppets have long arms, so they can really emote and do Shakespeare. They can always look great, no matter who's using them.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Well, because puppets are so different – tiny, huge; I know people who use everyday objects to make puppets – an egg crate, or a pair of scissors. So a puppeteer is somebody who throws themself into something outside. You throw your opinions and characteristics into that outside object. That's what a puppeteer is, in my opinion.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">There was a period you couldn't say that, puppet master. But in a sense, yes. Like those Japanese artists who are the only ones who know how to weave sea silk, I'm a puppet master in the sense that I know an awful lot about what to do with a piece of cardboard – something other people have no reason to know. Puppet master isn't a real term. It's something people say about someone who can do things that other people can't necessarily. When I started doing these workshop parades, where we put together a parade with people who haven't done one, that was like "Ok, I'm a master." Because I'm doing something people don't do, or wouldn't want to.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Yes, actually. I used to do workshops in all the community centers around Boston, and I hired three youths from one of them to work on the First Night parade. Lately, they've been able to run the parade. I can just go home because they know how to do it.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Sara</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Yeah, I didn't take them on as apprentices. They were there; they learned how to do it; they seemed quite happy that they can run a parade. Two of them got engaged.</div>
