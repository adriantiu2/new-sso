            <div class="interview-intro">
              <p>Princess Demeny is a poet, musician, painter, and filmmaker based in Montreal. Her song, New York Grief, was originally made in 1986, a record she describes as her "love child" with her then-boyfriend Jean Mineau, who arranged and recorded the track. Due to his untimely passing, the song was never released. In 2021, Séance Centre, a record label and distributor, published the song to streaming services. This digitization of the song exposed Princess Demeny's music to an entirely new audience, catapulting it into the playlists of radio DJs and Spotify users alike. I hadn't listened to my Discover Weekly in months, but I had hit a wall with my music selection, so I decided, hey, why not? Let me give it another shot. Within a few skips, a beautifully haunting synth droned through my speakers. The voice of a woman cut through the instrumental, yearningly singing, "Something happened in my dreams last night." The song, fittingly titled New York Grief, transported me to a dark, misty, street in New York City, her sonic arrangements setting up a cinematic spectacle. I was left unsatisfied after my google search for "Princess Demeny" and wanted to know more. The plan was to go up to Montreal, but things changed last minute. This interview takes place over email. All photos were generously supplied by Princess Demeny.</p>

              <div class="interview-response">I was born and raised in Montreal, but I hold 2 nationalities because my father  was from Budapest, so I was able to obtain my European passport for Hungary.  It came in handy when my daughter decided to live in France.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">My earliest memory of art is when my mother bought me a children's nursery rhyme poem book. Since I was a very, very shy child I had trouble expressing  myself outward, so I went inward for the most part. That book gave me a way to  express myself. The first poem I wrote was right after my mom told me like  everyone else, she was going to die one day. I had a mini meltdown and then I  wrote a several pages long poem about a frog and an old lady that become  friends and when the frog finds out that the old lady is going to die and he gets  so upset he cries a pond of tears around him and drowns in his sorrow. I did the  cover 3D by using macaroni elbow noodles in the shape of the characters.  After my parents' divorce my father used to take us to the drive-in theater and  since my wasn't there to exercise maternal control, he'd expose us to movies  that were not really made for children like David Cronenbergs' Shivers. Later on  I became a huge fan of his work and I would go see his films in repertoire theaters and watch them over and over - films like Scanners, Videodrome which  is an absolute masterpiece.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">When I was 12 or 13 years old I was invited to a friend's house to listen to some of her albums on her record player. She was much older than me. She put on  an album by the B-52's. I was like "what is this". It blew my mind right out of this  world and onto Planet Claire and there was no turning back. I cut off my hair  and bought some stilettos. Within the same year I found and got very attracted  to the chaotic political anger of punk music. So much energy gets burned  moshing to punk music. I loved the social commentary and criticism of the  institutional and industrial world we live in. I was down for it. I started writing my  own political poetry. Then I was swept away by the dark ethereal wave of poetic  underground electronic music movement with groups like Cocteau Twins,  Bauhaus, Fad Gadjet ... As a teen I really loved Altered States by Ken Russell  with William Hurt. It was very inspiring to think we can travel so deep with our  minds even though it was drug induced it was a window. Cronenberg's film  were really quite intriguing and inspiring for me. He guiltlessly goes to the dark  with provocative imagery.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">From your music, films, to your presence online, there is a mysterious  quality that is common among your work—they all feel like a dream. Was  that something that came about naturally or was it a quality that you were  seeking to achieve. If so, why?</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Princess Demeny</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I've always been an avid daydreamer and a vivid dreamer when I sleep. My  dreams are so real that I frequently wake up from talking or screaming aloud in  my sleep. I scare my family sometimes! I'm ultra fascinated by this language  coming out of my subconscious mind that speaks to me in metaphors. The  subconscious mind stores all your information, fears, desires, dreams, your past. In my twenties I really desperately was searching for answers to the inner turmoil  I was living with, and the answers seemed to be in my subconscious mind and I  wanted to desperately understand and therefore delved into the deeper parts of  the mind to get answers. I'm fascinated by how dreams play a part in multiple realities we exist in. Like where we actually go to get the energy to continue our  existence. There is no way it cannot affect my work. There is definitely a thread  in a lot of my work that's for sure.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Princess Demeny</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I was invited to a party in New York City in late 1985. It was a huge party for a  collective of photographers. It was held in a massive industrial loft filled with  hundreds of people. Some artists, a lot of artists. I had met Alan Golay a Swiss  French painter that lived and painted in New York from 80 to 90. We were  chatting when a photographer from NYC named Michael walked up to us and  snapped a few pictures of us. He was quite an interesting character. Very intense  and charming. He whisked me out of that party and led me into a portal of an  underground world. Back alleys with back-alley doors with makeshift bars. Like a  scene from Clock Work Orange. Then he brought me to a boat attached to a  dock called the purple Barge and then he disappears. It was a large boat with felt  like hundreds of people on it. I couldn't find him and I was inebriated and  exhausted the sun was rising so I walked back to the hotel, and it was morning  by then. I got to see NYC wake up. Looking into the haunting eyes of the working  class. It was really stark contrast. I crashed in my hotel and woke up and penned  out NYG. Just came right out of me. So yes, I wrote NYG in NYC. I got back to MTL I was invited to an after hours and introduced to a young man  named Jean Mineau. I had been single for a long time, and I wasn't interested in  being in a relationship but when we looked at each other and the world around us  melted away. We went back to his place and for a tea and to continue  conversation. He asked me what I wanted to do with my life. At the time I was  writing and acting in theater. I said I'm flying I don't know yet, but I write poems.  That was my constant. He asked to hear one and I just happened to have NYG in  my purse. I pulled it out and read it and he said that sounds like a song and he  went to get his guitar out. I told him I don't know how to sing, and he said just  sing it in your regular angelic voice. NYG was born, our first love child.</div>

              <div class="interview-response"> No, definitely not. Maybe for a little while in my teens. I was writing politically  charged poetry. Maybe there was a little while I envisioned being in a punk band.  I had actually started one with my sister but It didn't work out and I met someone  straight out of high school and we moved in together and he was very mentally  abusive. He convinced me that I was worthless when in actuality it was what he  believed in himself. But he had a grip on me for many years. Till I escaped his  clutch.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">I started going to NYC in my teens to get vinyls mostly but also, to get some  crazy bad ass clothing from thrift stores in Greenwich Village impossible to find in MTL. NYC had a wild nightlife. I truly believe the best in the world. You could go  wild and be yourself and no one would judge you. I felt so free in NY. I felt I could  be myself and the people loved it. My mother was an 18-wheeler truck driver and  her route was mainly MTL/NYC. I hitched a ride with her all the time, so I was in  NYC frequently. The last time i was in NYC was 2013. I was with family, and we  did the tourist New Year Eve ball drop. We were sardined in times square with  thousands and I really did not enjoy myself. I felt totally disconnected from NY.  I'm a traveler but then felt like a tourist. I'm never doing a tourist trip ever again.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Princess Demeny</div>
              <div class="interview-response">It kind of defines itself by being out of the mainstream and not popular. Its music  and art that is to either to challenging or original for commercial media to invest in  it. Not bankable or a safe bet for the investors. I was totally immersed in the  underground working mostly in underground nightclubs and doing shows with  other underground artists including drag queens for years. Brought me even  closer to other artists with like minds that also craved the bohemian underground  lifestyle. I'm not against pop but have never and will never try to make music to  become popular but I am not against my songs getting recognized and  appreciated. I love connecting to people through art.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Princess Demeny</div>
              <div class="interview-response">MTL and NY influence each other. But Mtl is a tamer version. There's less crime,  less struggle, that being said there's less of the level of intensity that often  inspires artists. I needed the intensity that NYC could provide. So many eccentric  artists live and roam the streets of NY. Anything goes and anything can happen  at any time...its magic. There is also a greater appreciation and respect for artists  in NY. Its to easy in MTL to survive but there isn't as big a support system and  appreciation for the arts that's for sure.</div>

Anyone can make a film even with a cell  phone. Music is so much easier to make with DAWS. The artist is free and its  time for them to take power and some are. The power is at the fingertips.

              <div class="interview-speaker">Princess Demeny</div>
              <div class="interview-response">Princess Anita Demeny is my birth name. The story my mom told me was the  reason she called me Princess was because my 2 sisters born before me had closed fists like little fists ready to fight whereas I was born with pinkies in the air  like a royalty. Like a Princess. Much to my father's dismay she went ahead and  named me Princess.</div>

              <div class="interview-speaker">Princess Demeny</div>
              <div class="interview-response">I think it takes a lot of courage to stand on a stage and bare your soul. You have  to bring your light and shine it. Princess is a name that almost demands a  persona. When I decided to take my first name back it was not welcomed by  anyone around me. Princess is associated with Royalty and Disney characters.  They knew me as Anita but I was no longer her. I had done an enormous amount  of soul searching. She was dead to me. Anita was broken by years of being  bullied in school, then years of mental abuse in bad relationships, ridiculed in  public for my clothing choices and then worst of all I turned on myself and  became self destructive. I didn't want be her anymore. I started to love myself in  the right way – spiritually. The minute my foot got on the stage Anita died. When I  was in university it took me a bit longer but then I started to win outstanding  awards and my courage kicked it and I used my first name for my film work as  well. Princess is my phoenix name and my persona but, it's just who I am. It is my name.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">In 2011 I uploaded a children's book I wrote, illustrated and narrated onto  YouTube. Its called The Very Very Shy Butterfly. I wrote it for children that suffer  from social anxiety. Then in 2016 I uploaded NYG music video because my best friend Garth passed away and I was overtaken by grief. We had worked together  on many projects for years and I loved him deeply. I wanted his family to see his  beauty. Finally, my husband pestered me to uploaded some electronic danse  music I did in the late 80's. The MeC3D EP. So I uploaded that in 2017. I'm really a physical person so I'm not really good with social media. I'm trying really hard  to embrace it. Its not because I'm old I have a lot of my friends that are amazing  at it. Its just every time I want to post something I get conflicting feelings. I'm working on it.</div>

He saw that I had other  electronic music as well. So, I guess it was a good thing I posted it on YouTube. When he found out about the 1986 version and his big brain lit up and he sent  me digging in boxes that were buried in my basement for decades. He got NYG  and other music I did with the late and great Jean Mineau transferred in a studio  in TO and him and Naomi Hoccura came up with the idea to do a single first.  Then later this fall they will be releasing an extended EP!</div>

              <div class="interview-response">It's a bit about my artistic journey but its also about what happened with Seance  Centre. They came into my life, and I was in the middle of casting for my second  feature a psychological horror called Virginia. In 2020 I was ready to shoot then  the pandemic came along and my production was shut down and I slid into  darkness. Finally in 2021 the single came out and it was kind of a healing  experience. Its almost a miracle in a way. It's also about my experience with Jean  Mineau. Last April, Gary the Tall, a DJ from London, UK, on his NTS radio show  called Reign called NYG the greatest love song of any era prior or going forward  because of how Jean and I birthed that song. He included NYG in a brilliant  tracklist.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Nothing is one dimensional for me. We come from energy that connects to the  vast and powerful Universe. Nothing is what it seems. Everything is mutating and  evolving and everything is connected to everything. My work is frequently multi  dimensional. I want it to go to the deep and I'm not afraid to explore the darkness  within myself and within humanity. It's asking to be explored and I don't have the  truth and I don't search for it anymore. My work is just the meaning I'm finding as I'm exploring on this journey. I grapple with the issues of life and death.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">I was making a music video for The Dance Rats from the MeC3D EP and I just  completely fell in love with the process and a friend suggested I go to University to study film. In my mind there was no way that could be possible because I  barely passed in high school and I didn't go to college. I decided to give it a shot.  I shot a short film called Hogtied. It was about a girl that had been drugged at a  social event and later raped. It was based on a true story, but I wrote with an  alternate ending where she is able to hogtie him and insists they play charades  so he can try to guess what she has in her hands. I had written it as a theater  piece and performed it on stage and it had a very positive reaction, especially  with women. When I presented the short film in the audition to the faculty  selection committee, the reaction was quite positive. Months later I got the  answer by letter that I was accepted into to do a BFA in The Film Production  program - it was a transcendental moment.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">The idea came to me right after I had completed Surface In 1992. One of my  favorite films is Birdy directed by Allan Parker with Nicolas Cage. It had deeply  moved me the way our minds can get broken, but we can fix them. I wanted to do  a film that reflected my personal journey of healing. I couldn't tell it as a regular  linear story. Because it happened on multiple levels of existence. It happened in  my mind and in my body and then in my soul. I had to reach to the depth of my experience. I couldn't stay on the surface of reality. I felt that it had to be shot in  an altered state of reality. But the problem was I had completed my final film in  Concordia and finished the requirements to obtain a BFA. The head of the film  department Deborah called me into her office and said your finished your degree  what do you want to do. Most, if not all students were in a rush to get out but I  didn't want to leave. I hadn't done all the courses in film study I wanted, and I  wanted to do another film. And furthermore, I needed the film equipment. I  wanted to shoot it in film. I mean video was out there but it was ugly as shit.  Because I had excelled in my program and won a few awards they gave me an  extension and called it a specialization. I was ultra passionate about Isolation and  completely obsessed. The University had a strict rule that the film could not go  beyond 20 minutes so I had to continue working on it outside of the University. I  managed to get a pafts grant at the NFB and they helped me finish it. It took me  2 years and I was pretty burnt out.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">For the time being I have finished a few songs with my daughter Lua. She  Produced a few songs for me to encourage me to get back into it. Then she took  her space back to do her own thang. She working on her own EP. She does  music and DJ's under the name Lune Dit. She persuaded me to learn Ableton  and I finally did so right now I'm exploring and experimenting. Its incredible how  technology has freed and empowered artists. On the other hand I'm not  classically trained so I'm really hoping to work with other artists eventually. At the same time my daughter is writing an even lower budget script in her spare time for me. Even lower budget than the last one since I sank all my money in it. She  finished a BA in Literature and film studies so she's quite capable. I gave her a  short treatment of an idea for a dark psychological sci fi thriller, and she is  working on the first draft. I'm hoping to go into production with it in mid 2024.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">In the 90's I was only painting on objects I found along the road side. Like I found  an old TV and I turned the inner tube around and attached it to a mannequin's face with a vacuum hose. I called it TV OD and I painted the tv tube as a target. I  wasn't a huge fan of television for the most part. I guess they were more like  painted garbage. I painted on windows and did sculptures out of take-out pamphlets. But now I'm painting acrylic on cavas and and water ink on paper.  Right now I'm fascinated with things we cant see with the human eye like - cell  mutation, dna, germs. I call this series mutation and I mostly use sushi take out  containers to mold and texture the paint sometimes even crawling off the canvas  at times.</div>

              <div class="interview-response">Because of NYG I'm being exposed to an enormous amount of new and really  interesting music. For example, I recently discovered the music of a NY  electronic experimental artist called Brian Degraw. I really love his latest album  called Sum/One. He's really talented at layering electro acoustic sound. What is  really the most interesting since the SC release of NYG Is the different types of  tracklists it's been played on from DJ's all around the globe. Im discovering music I would never have found. I listen to the tracklist NYG is mixed in with and I  relisten to a lot of them. These DJ's are passionate and take time to find music  that is sometimes buried in boxes in basements and would never be heard if it  wasn't for them. Its a new world and simply awesome and amazing for artists  right now. I listen to tracklists all the time and everyday. Some are for car rides,  bath time, exercising. I hate exercising so I decided to do it through dancing.  Which is the best because you're moving your whole body. NYG is mixed in with  so many different genres of music style from Punk, soul, electronic, dark synth to  ethereal wave. They created so many genres and sub genres that my head is  spinning but what's amazing is that NYG mixes well into so many different  genres.</div>

He loved my film and  wanted to work with me as well. We tried to break into the film industry together.  He's a very talented script writer and he absolutely wanted me to direct his scripts so I developed the scripts he wrote. It lead us deep into the dark side of  the filmmaking industry for a least a decade. It was hell. Finally one day I told  him, "I'm done, I'm never meeting a producer again. I'm going to rely on my spirit  to manifest." He laughed at me and said" where's the money gonna come from  your back yard". At that moment I was looking out to my backyard from my  dinkey teeny tiny little cottage. I decided to sell my house and buy some rental  properties until I had enough money to survive and make a fuckin film! It took a  decade. I had been working at some pretty hard jobs, so I had had enough! I  wanted to be my own boss. It worked out. I have a enough income to stay at  home and do art or music. I show up in my home studio everyday, ready to be inspired.</div>

Maybe one day. I'm  working on it.</div>
